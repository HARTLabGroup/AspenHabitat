## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
aspen <- raster(here("Data", "Spatial", "Aspen", "srme_skcv_probability_mosaic-90.tif"))


pal <- colorNumeric(c("#0C2C84", "#41B6C4", "#FFFFCC"), values(aspen),
  na.color = "transparent")

leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>%
  addRasterImage(aspen, colors = pal, opacity = 0.8) %>%
  addLegend(pal = pal, values = values(aspen),
    title = "Surface temp")
```
