## Description of the project

This repository contains all code for *Climate-driven decreases in
aspen's distribution and opportunities for future expansion across the
Southern Rocky Mountains*.

## Organization of the project

The project has the following structure:

-   [**Code**](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/tree/base/Code):
    All code written for this project

    -   [**AspenHabitatModelling.docx**](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/AspenHabitatModelling.docx):
        A Microsoft Word version of the the manuscript generated from
        AspenHabitatModelling.Rmd

    -   [**AspenHabitatModelling.rmd**](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/AspenHabitatModelling.Rmd)
        : An R Markdown file containing all code and text

    -   [**GIDS-Downscaling-SJH.R**](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/GIDS-Downscaling-SJH.R):
        An R file that performs a multi-step procedure that spatially
        downscales gridded climate data using GIDS (Gradient and Inverse
        Distance-Squared) of Nalder and Wein (1998) and Flint and Flint
        (2012). It was lightly modified from code written by Rodman et
        al. (2020).

-   [**Documents**](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/tree/base/Documents)
    : This folder contains tables generated in Microsoft Excel that are
    used in the main text of AspenHabitatModelling.docx

    -   [**ODMAP-Table.xlsx**](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Documents/ODMAP-Table.xlsx)
        :

    -   [**PredictorScreeningTable.xlsx**](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Documents/PredictorScreeningTable.xlsx){.uri}
        :

-   [**Figures**](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/tree/base/Figures)
    : This folder contains any figures that were not generated by the
    provided code.

    -   StudyArea.jpg : A map of the study area generated in
        [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/).

-   .gitignore

-   [**AspenHabitat.Rproj**](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/AspenHabitat.Rproj)
    : The RStudio project file for this project
